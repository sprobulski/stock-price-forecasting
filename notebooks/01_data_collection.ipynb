    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook establishes the data collection framework for our stock price forecasting model. The approach integrates multiple data sources to capture both company-specific performance metrics and broader market dynamics that influence equity valuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our methodology addresses three critical data dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Data**: We collect comprehensive OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for the target security, alongside relevant market benchmarks including broad market indices and sector-specific ETFs. This provides both absolute performance metrics and relative positioning context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Macroeconomic Indicators**: Economic fundamentals significantly impact equity markets. We source key indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, including interest rates, inflation metrics, employment statistics, and economic activity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Context**: To understand relative performance and sector dynamics, we collect data on relevant market indices, volatility measures, and sector-specific benchmarks that provide comparative context for our target security.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection process utilizes APIs from Yahoo Finance for market data and FRED for economic indicators. All data is normalized to daily frequency with appropriate forward-filling for economic indicators that report at lower frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality controls include validation of date ranges, handling of missing values, and verification of data completeness across all sources. The pipeline generates comprehensive metadata documenting collection timestamps, data sources, and quality metrics for reproducibility and audit purposes."
